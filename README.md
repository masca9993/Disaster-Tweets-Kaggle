The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies)

## Code

First part of the project is about tokenization and preprocessing of the dataset, then those differents models are trained on the training dataset:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Network
- Random Forest
